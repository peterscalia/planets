Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons 
The dog will appreciate the lack of humidity
This is a bad change
I love the weather up here
Where is the oxygen?


The oxygen will come. 
The microorganisms will breathe. 
The plants will grow. 
The people with seethe. 
A new planet. 
That's not theirs to keep.
